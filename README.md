# Random-Text
A Python program that determines whether or not a piece of text is gibberish or not, and if it is, if it is the result of keyboard mashing or is randomly generated. Made as part of Purdue Adventures in Computer Science 2018

We worked until the very end on this project and I don't believe it is truly complete. I forked this project so that I could continue working on it on my own time and fixing all the bugs that have arisen without committing directly to Zach's repository. Maybe at some point I will merge with his repository.
